#  Web Visualization Dashboard (Lattitude)

### Created a visualization dashboard website for the analysis of weather in different cities of the world across the globe.

### https://github.com/beashetkar/HW12-Web-Visualization-Dashboard/


In this project utilizes Python, API’s, and JSON traversals to try and answer a fundamental question:
“What’s the weather like as we get closer to the equator?”

With using Python CitiPy library and OpenWeatherMapAPI, I got the weather for the cities (using the nearest lat-lng)
and assembled a dataset of weather information for over 500 unique cities.
                        
After assembling the dataset, the data is analyzed across the three climate zones (Tropical Zone, Temperate Zone, and
Polar Zone). To showcase the relationship between Latitude vs.
